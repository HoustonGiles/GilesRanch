<p>Our cattle all 100% grass fed <em>and</em> finshed.  By that we mean that they are raised on their mother's milk and on what forage they can get from the pastures as well as supplemental hay as necessary during the winter.  They also receive an all natural mineral supplement and loose rock salt.  They are raised naturally, which means that we do not use any hormones, steroids, performance enhancers, etc.  Whatever they get, they get what God provides from the ground. We also do not use any chemical pesticides on our pastures but rely on rotational grazing and occasional mowing to keep the weeds at bay.  We strive for an organic environment.

<p>We have several breeds of cows.  We try to choose those breeds that are best suited for good grass fed beef.  Most of our cows are smaller, English type breeds which tends to make them more efficient at converting grass to meat.  These include Scottish Highlands,, Shorthorn, Angus, Murray Grey and British White.  Our goal is not to produce the biggest cows, but produce the best meat for your table.</p>

<p>We use Murray Grey bulls on our cows which produces excellent grass fed beef with more marbling from only pasture.  Murray Grey cattle were developed in Australia during the last century, and were first imported to the United States in 1970.  Murray Greys combine the best traits of their parent breeds into a very unique, all beef breed.  Murray Grey cattle have the excellent temperament, thriftiness and meat tenderness of the Shorthorns and the marbling traits of the original Scotch Aberdeen Angus.  They produce an excellent grass finished beef.</p>

<p><strong>PRICING</strong>
Our beef cost $4.00 per pound of hanging weight, plus processing charges, currently about $.55 per pound of hanging weight, plus $0.30 per pound for any ground beef made into patties or round steak tenderizing.  (The $0.30 per pound is only charged on the packaged weight of patties and tenderized round steak, so if you don't get patties or tenderizing, that charge does not apply.)  For processing, we use a local family owned USDA inspected plant.  We dry age our beef 14-21 days before final cutting to improve tenderness and flavor.  All cut meat is vacuum packed.</p>

<p>We estimate to get about 55-65% of the hanging weight into packaged meat.  If you also include the organ meats, tongue, extra fat, and extra bones, the ratio should be a little higher.  If you want only ground beef, this ratio would be a little lower due to the lack of bones.  For a 500 pound hanging weight, a beef would figure like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>500# x 1/4 (quarter beef) = 125# hanging weight x ($3.50 meat cost + $0.55 processing cost) = $506.25 for about 65-75# of packaged beef.  The hanging weight can vary from 400 to 600 pounds, but will likely be closer to 500.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is a $100 deposit on the meat to hold your order.  If you order 1/2 or a whole beef, you can have the meat custom packaged to your specifications.  For 1/4 beef, we use a standard cut package that most people enjoy.</p>
