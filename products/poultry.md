**CHICKENS FOR MEAT**
Our broilers are raised in several batches throughout the warmer months of the year.  In addition to the fresh pasture they enjoy every day, we also feed them a custom mixed organic grain ration.  This way we know exactly what ingredients go into the ration and are comfortable that we're feeding an organic, all-natural product.  This ration is produced at a certified organic grain mill and contains no GMO grains.

The first batch of chickens is processed near the end of May with other batches to follow throughout the year depending on customer demand.  We can supply our customers with smaller fryer size birds that weigh about 4 pounds, or with roaster size birds, which are in the 6-7 pound size range.  If you haven't had the pleasure of eating a six pound pastured raised bird that's been soaked overnight in one of our customers special brine recipe, and then roasted on an outdoor smoker all day, your missing out!

**PRICING**
Chickens (approximately 4-6 pounds)	$3.00/lb dressed weight
**Note: Pricing is based on customer pick up at Giles Ranch.*
