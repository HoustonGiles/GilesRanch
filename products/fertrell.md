We have all natural and organic livestock mineral supplements as well as organic lawn, garden and pasture fertilizers available.  There was not a local supplier for some of the supplements that we use, so we decided to carry the products so that we and other local farmers and homeowners would have a more convenient, local source. 

Our beef and dairy cows receive [Redmond Trace Mineral Salt][1], [Fertrell Grazier's Choice][2], and [Fertrell North Atlantic Kelp Meal][3] for supplemental vitamins and minerals.  Our poultry receive [Fertrell Organic Nutribalancer][4] in their feed ration.  These are all natural products that have been very beneficial for our animals. 

While our main focus remains producing all natural, healthy livestock for local consumers, we felt that having a local source of these supplements would be beneficial. 

In addition to these supplements, we are able to supply other items from the [Fertrell][5] company for both farmers and home owners.  In addition to all natural and organic supplements, the [Fertrell][5] company also carries a variety of organic [soil care products][6] for lawns, gardens, and pastures.  You can learn more about the full line of product offerings at Fetrell's website, [http://www.fertrell.com][5].
