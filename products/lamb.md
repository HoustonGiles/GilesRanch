We weren't sure about lamb  We'd heard many say that they didn't like the flavor, but those people had bought their lamb at the store or had it in a restaurant.  Since we don't use herbicides, we had originally acquired our sheep as a means to help keep the weeds down in the pastures.  We hoped that we would like the meat.  What we found was that the meat from our grass fed lambs is great!  It's very similar to beef, but does have it's own flavor and tends to be a little milder.  It is excellent grilled, in stews, or ground.  If you haven't had the chance to try lamb, we encourage you to try some chops on the grill or ground lamb as burgers, or for a really special treat, try some lamb breakfast sausage!

As with our other animals, our sheep and lambs spend their life on pasture freely grazing fresh forage.  In the winter we supplement with hay as necessary. They also have access to the same all natural mineral supplements that our cows get.  Like our beef, these are raised all naturally without any drugs or chemicals, not even wormers.

We chose Khatadin sheep as they are a "hair" sheep (don't require shearing), and they are known to have a higher resistance to parasites than some other breeds.  We run the sheep with the cows in the same paddocks at the same time.  The cows help clean up after the sheep, and the sheep help clean up after the cows.  They are very complimentary animals. 

We'll have a limited supply of lambs available this year.  Please give us a call at (417)621-5476 or email us at [gilesranch@gmail.com][2] to reserve yours.
