                <p class="feature-paragraph"><img data-img-src="assets/images/river_sheep.jpg" class="lazy pull-right squared_border" alt="">We are a small farm in Southwest Missouri just north of the Joplin/Carthage area dedicated to raising all natural <a href="#products">grassfed beef and grassfed lamb</a>. By all natural, we mean that our animals are not given steroids, hormones, or antibiotics. We strive to give them a fresh, healthy, stress-free environment. We do our best to care for our land and raise all of our livestock organically. </p>
                <h4>All Natural, Grassfed</h4>
                <p>We believe that the most nutritious and healtful foods are those that are produced without chemicals or pesticides. For cattle and sheep, we believe that entails spending their lives grazing pastures free from commerical fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, etc.  For more information about the benefits of eating all natural grassfed products, please visit <a href="http://www.eatwild.com" target="_blank">Eatwild.com</a>.</p>

                  <h1>Stewardship</h1>
                  <p>Our goal with all of our livestock is to provide all natural, healthy, chemical free, grassfed products. We want to be good stewards of the land that God has so graciously provided us, and also care well for the animals with which we've been blessed to be stewards. </p>
                  <p>We truly believe that by producing all natural grassfed products, we can help improve peoples health and lives by providing them with a healthy alternative to many of the products found at most grocery stores.

                  <h3>Beef Cattle</h3>
                  <p><img data-img-src="assets/images/brown_calf_cropped.jpg" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-right" alt="">Our beef cattle are fed fresh pasture or hay. The only supplements they receive in addition to their daily pasture and/or hay are natural minerals including kelp meal, loose trace mineral rock salt, and organic mineral supplements. </p>
                  <p>We do not use any artificial enhancers such as hormones, steroids, medicated feed, etc. We also do not use any chemical pesticides on our pastures, but rely on our rotational grazing practices and occasional mowing to keep the weeds at bay.</p>
                  <h3>Hair Sheep</h3>
                  <p><img data-img-src="assets/images/ewe.jpg" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-left" alt="">Sheep have been a wonderful addition to our ranch. The sheep graze together with the cows and mix in very well. As with our beef, our sheep and lambs do not receive anything other than pasture, hay and all natural minerals. No chemicals, no drugs, not even wormers. We're excited to be able to offer organically raised grass fed lamb.</p>

By that we mean that they are raised on their mother's milk and on what forage they can get from the pastures as well as supplemental hay as necessary during the winter. They also receive an all natural mineral supplement and loose rock salt.</p>
                      <p> They are raised naturally, which means that we do not use any hormones, steroids, performance enhancers, etc. Whatever they get, they get what God provides from the ground.

                        <p><img data-img-src="assets/images/bull_square.jpg" class="lazy rounded_border hover_effect pull-left" alt="Beef">We have several breeds of cows. We try to choose those breeds that are best suited for good grass fed beef. Most of our cows are smaller, English type breeds which tends to make them more efficient at converting grass to meat. These include Scottish Highlands,, Shorthorn, Angus, Murray Grey and British White. Our goal is not to produce the biggest cows, but produce the best meat for your table.</p>
                        <p>We use Murray Grey bulls on our cows which produces excellent grass fed beef with more marbling from only pasture. Murray Grey cattle were developed in Australia during the last century, and were first imported to the United States in 1970. Murray Greys combine the best traits of their parent breeds into a very unique, all beef breed. Murray Grey cattle have the excellent temperament, thriftiness and meat tenderness of the Shorthorns and the marbling traits of the original Scotch Aberdeen Angus. They produce an excellent grass finished beef.</p>

                      <p>We weren't sure about lamb. We'd heard many say that they didn't like the flavor, but those people had bought their lamb at the store or had it in a restaurant.</p>
                      <p>Since we don't use herbicides, we had originally acquired our sheep as a means to help keep the weeds down in the pastures. We hoped that we would like the meat. What we found was that the meat from our grass fed lambs is great! It's very similar to beef, but does have it's own flavor and tends to be a little milder.</p>
                      <p>It is excellent grilled, in stews, or ground. If you haven't had the chance to try lamb, we encourage you to try some chops on the grill or ground lamb as burgers, or for a really special treat, try some lamb breakfast sausage!</p>

In the winter we supplement with hay as necessary. They also have access to the same all natural mineral supplements that our cows get. Like our beef, these are raised all naturally without any drugs or chemicals, not even wormers.</p>
                        <p>We chose Khatadin sheep for our base as they are a "hair" sheep (don't require shearing), and they are known to have a higher resistance to parasites than some other breeds. We also have some Dorpers in the mix which gives the cross a little more meat.  We run the sheep with the cows in the same paddocks at the same time. The cows help clean up after the sheep, and the sheep help clean up after the cows. They are very complimentary animals.</p>
                        <p>We'll have a limited supply of lambs available this year. Please give us a call at (417)621-5476 or email us at <a href="mailto:gilesranch@gmail.com">gilesranch@gmail.com</a> to reserve yours.</p>

                    <h1>Beef Pricing</h1>
                    <p>Our beef cost $4.00 per pound of hanging weight, plus processing charges, currently about $.60 per pound of hanging weight, plus $0.30 per pound for any ground beef made into patties or round steak tenderizing.  (The $0.30 per pound is only charged on the packaged weight of patties and tenderized round steak, so if you don't get patties or tenderizing, that charge does not apply.)  For processing, we use a local family owned USDA inspected plant.  We dry age our beef 14-21 days before final cutting to improve tenderness and flavor.  All cut meat is vacuum packed.</p>

                    <p>We estimate to get about 55-65% of the hanging weight into packaged meat.  If you also include the organ meats, tongue, extra fat, and extra bones, the ratio should be a little higher.  If you want only ground beef, this ratio would be a little lower due to the lack of bones.  For a 500 pound hanging weight, a beef would figure like this:</p>

                    <blockquote><p>500# x 1/4 (quarter beef) = 125# hanging weight x ($4.00 meat cost + $0.60 processing cost) = $575 for about 65-75# of packaged beef.  The hanging weight can vary from 400 to 600 pounds, but will likely be closer to 500.</p></blockquote>

                    <p>There is a $100 deposit on the meat to hold your order.  If you order 1/2 or a whole beef, you can have the meat custom packaged to your specifications.  For 1/4 beef, we use a standard cut package that most people enjoy.</p>

                    <p>Our lamb cost $4.00 per pound of hanging weight, plus processing charges, which is currently $70.00 per lamb.  For processing, we use a local family owned USDA inspected plant.  All cut meat is vacuum packed.</p>

                    <p>We estimate to get about 50-60% of the hanging weight into packaged meat.  If you also include the organ meats, tongue, extra fat, and extra bones, the ratio should be a little higher.  For a 60 pound hanging weight, a lamb would figure like this:</p>

                    <blockquote><p>60# x $4.00 meat cost = $240 plus $70 processing which totals $310 for 30-35# of packaged lamb.  The hanging weight can vary from 50 to 70 pounds, but will likely be closer to 60.</p></blockquote>
