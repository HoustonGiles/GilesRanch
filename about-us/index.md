We are a small farm in Southwest Missouri just north of the Joplin/Carthage area dedicated to raising all natural grass fed beef and grass fed lamb.  By all natural, we mean that our animals are not given steroids, hormones, or antibiotics.  We strive to give them a fresh, healthy, stress-free environment.  We do our best to care for our land and raise all of our livestock organically.  We believe that the most nutritious and healtful foods are those that are produced without chemicals or pesticides.  For more information about the benefits of eating all natural grassfed products, please visit [Eatwild.com][1]. 

Our beef cattle are fed only fresh pasture or hay.  The only supplements they receive in addition to their daily pasture and/or hay are natural minerals including kelp meal, loose rock salt, and organic mineral supplements.  We do not use any artificial enhancers such as hormones, steroids, medicated feed, etc.  We also do not use any chemical pesticides on our pastures, but rely on our rotational grazing practices and occasional mowing to keep the weeds at bay. 

Sheep have been a wonderful addition to our ranch.  The sheep graze together with the cows and mix in very well.  As with our beef, our sheep and lambs do not receive anything other than pasture, hay and all natural minerals.  No chemicals, no drugs, not even wormers.  We're excited to be able to offer organically raised grass fed lamb. 

Our goal with all of our livestock is to provide all natural, healthy, chemical free, grassfed products.  We want to be good stewards of the land that God has so graciously provided us, and also care well for the animals with which we've been blessed to be stewards.  We truly believe that by producing all natural grassfed products, we can help improve peoples health and lives by providing them with a healthy alternative to many of the products found at most grocery stores.
